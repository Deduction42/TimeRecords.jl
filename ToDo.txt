ToDo:

1.  Add toggle option to avoid displaying as "DateTime" (in case someone uses a different offset for precision)
2.  Add RegularTimeSeries with special "find" methods (that would be very fast)
    - internals contains: (1)<timstamps> an abstract range and (2)<values> a vector of raw values
    - getindex returns the constructed TimeRecord
    - `timeseries(t, v)` will return RegularTimeSeries if t is an abstract range
3.  Add documentation

Plot Recipe notes (in case of improvements):
    - https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/RecipesBase/syntax/
    - potential solution:
        @recipe f(ts::TimeSeries; use_dates=true) = use_dates ? (datetimes(ts), values(ts)) : (timestamps(ts), values(ts))
    - more advanced functionality (potetially resolution, and you definitely want rotation)
