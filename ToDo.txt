ToDo:
v2.0.3 Have options for dealing with datetime precision issues
    - Create "stamp2datetime" and "datetime2stamp" that can handle arbitrary references and missing values
        stamp2unix(x::Real) = x + ORIGIN_FLOAT[]
        unix2stamp(x::Real) = x - ORIGIN_FLOAT[] 
        stamp2datetime(x::Real) = isnan(x) ? missing : unix2datetime(stamp2unix(x))
        datetime2stamp(x::DateTime) = unix2stamp(datetime2unix(x))
        datetime2stamp(x::Missing) = NaN
        set_date_origin(x::DateTime) = setindex!(ORIGIN_FLOAT, datetime2unix(x))
    - Float64 in Unix will only have microsecond precision near our date if the origin is Epoch
        - Much finer precision can be obtained by moving the origin closer to now
        - Changing the reference point only changes how "dates" are displayed
    - Add toggle option to display times as float instead of "DateTime"
        - This lives inside the "Base.show" function

v2.0.4 Add filtering functions
    - First-order lowpass filter 
    - First-order detrender (forgetful sum of diff)
    - double-filter for no phase lag

v2.1.0 Add RegularTimeSeries with special "find" methods (that would be very fast)
    - Stores timestamps as a reange and values as a raw vector
        - timestamps are of type StepRangeLen{Float64, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Int64}
        - values are just a plain vector with no timestamps
    - getindex returns the constructed TimeRecord
    - setindex! on a timerecord only works if the timestamp matches exactly
    - `timeseries(t, v)` will return RegularTimeSeries if t is an abstract range
        - Can also use interpolation/averaging on other timeseries to construct new timeseries if "v" is a timeseries
        - timeseries(t::AbstractRange, v::AbstractTimeSeries; order=0, method=interpolation)
        - averaging will produce one less element, and the "timestamp" assigned to an average is the end (to prevent "future contamination")
    - Change the hierarchy:
        - AbstractTimeSeries
            - AbstractRegularTS
                - RegularTimeseries, RegularTimeseriesView
            - AbstractIrregularTS 
                - TimeSeries, TimeSeriesView

v2.1.1 Add documentation


Plot Recipe notes (in case of improvements):
    - https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/RecipesBase/syntax/
    - potential solution:
        @recipe f(ts::TimeSeries; use_dates=true) = use_dates ? (datetimes(ts), values(ts)) : (timestamps(ts), values(ts))
    - more advanced functionality (potetially resolution, and you definitely want rotation)
