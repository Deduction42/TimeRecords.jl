# TimeRecords
This package provides a data structure framework to support record-driven timeseries analysis operatios allowing for easy interpolation, integration, merging and time-driven indexing. The motivating principle behind this package is to make it easier to deal with situations where time series data arrives one record at a time, and where there are no guarantees about sampling intervals. 

A common problem encountered is that most multivariate algorithms require complete observations for a given timestamp, but in many situations, data from different components are sampled at different times. The detailed interpolation, integration and time-based averaging methods in this package are built to deal with such situations. The basic building blocks of this package comprise of

1. `TimeRecord{T}` (a value of type `T` with a timestamp attached)
2. `AbstractTimeSeries{T}` (an `AbstractVector{TimeRecord{T}}` that is always sorted based on time)

For multivariate observations, the recommended DataType for each element is `SVector{N}`, but elements can consist of any custom object. Nevertheless, functionality may be limited on certain datatypes: 
 - Zeroth-order tnterpolation supports`TimeSeries{T}` of any element type. 
 - First-order interpolation requires the ability to add `T` and multiply `T` by floats. 
 - Integration and averaging also requires supporting the method `zero(T)` which is why `Vector` may not be a great element choice

## TimeRecord
```
struct TimeRecord{T} <: AbstractTimeRecord{T}
    t :: Float64
    v :: T
end
```
A wrapper that attaches a unix timestap to a value. Timestamps are stored internally as Float64.
```
tr = TimeRecord(0, 1.1)
>> TimeRecord{Float64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:00, v=1.1)

tr = TimeRecord(DateTime(2014, 09, 15), "Here's a random date")
>> TimeRecord{String}(t=2014-09-15T00:00:00, v="Here's a random date")
```
You can retrieve timestamps using `timestamp(tr)` or `datetime(tr)`
```
timestamp(tr)
>> 1.4107392e9
datetime(tr)
>> 2014-09-15T00:00:00
```
values are retrieved using `value(tr)`
```
value(tr)
>> "Here's a random date"
```

## TimeInterval
An object which stores two timestamps as a sorted vector. This is useful for integrals or queries on timestamps. Constructors can use either Real or DateTime as inputs.
```
dt = TimeInterval(0, 5); dt = TimeInterval(0=>5)
>> 1970-01-01T00:00:00 => 1970-01-01T00:00:05
```

## TimeSeries
A vector of time records which among other things, supports indexing using time intervals.

```
ts = TimeSeries([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,4,5])
>> 5-element TimeSeries{Int64}:
    TimeRecord{Int64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:01, v=1)
    TimeRecord{Int64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:02, v=2)
    TimeRecord{Int64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:03, v=3)
    TimeRecord{Int64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:04, v=4)
    TimeRecord{Int64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:05, v=5)

ts[TimeInterval(0=>3.1)]
>> 3-element TimeSeries{Int64}:
    TimeRecord{Int64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:01, v=1)
    TimeRecord{Int64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:02, v=2)
    TimeRecord{Int64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:03, v=3)
```
Some additional notes on TimeSeries
-  `records(ts::AbstractTimeSeries)` will return normal vector, but be careful about mutating it because it could violate some 'sorted' assumptions
-  `push!(ts::AbstractTimeSeries, r::TimeRecord)` will insert `r` into `ts` while maintaining chronological order
-  `setindex(AbstractTimeSeries, x, ind)` will only set the value, not the timestamp (in order to guarantee sorting). 
-   If timestamps need to be altered, use `deleteat!(ts, ind)` then `push!(ts, r, indhint=ind)`


## Interpolation
The first major functionality supported is interpolation. Supported interpolation methods are zero-order-hold (order=0) or linear (order=1). 

Regular interpolation uses flat-saturation if the timestamp is out of the timeseries range.

`interpolate(ts::AbstractTimeSeries, t::Union{<:Real, AbstractVector{<:Real}}; order=0)`

Strict interpolation will return a missing value if outside the range.

`strictinterp(ts::AbstractTimeSeries, t::Union{<:Real, AbstractVector{<:Real}}; order=0)`

## Integration
The second major functionality supported is integration (and averaging). Integration can be done over a simple TimeInterval, or on a vector of timestamps (where n values will result in n-1 integration intervals).
```
average(ts::AbstractTimeSeries{T}, vt::AbstractVector{<:Real}; order=1) where T
integral(ts::AbstractTimeSeries{T}, vt::AbstractVector{<:Real}; order=1) where T
accumulate(ts::AbstractTimeSeries{T}; order=1) where T
integral(ts::AbstractTimeSeries{T}, Î”t::TimeInterval, indhint=firstindex(ts); order=1) where T <: Number
```
## Merging
In many cases, it's desirable to have multivariate data where a full multivariate observation exists for every desired timestamp. However, it's often the case that different timestamps are available for different variables. The merging functionality finds the union of all timestamps and interpolates all timeseries, resulting in full multivariate observations for each timestamp. If desired timestamps are known, those can be provided. You can also provide a function to apply to the collection of observations (such as Vector, the default is Tuple)

```
merge(t::AbstractVector{<:Real}, vts::AbstractTimeSeries...; order=0)
merge(f::Union{Function,Type}, t::AbstractVector{<:Real}, vts::AbstractTimeSeries...; order=0)
merge(vts::AbstractTimeSeries...; order=0)
merge(f::Union{Function,Type}, vts::AbstractTimeSeries...; order=0)

ts2 = TimeSeries([1.5, 2.6], [1.5, 2.6])
>> 2-element TimeSeries{Float64}:
    TimeRecord{Float64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:01.500, v=1.5)
    TimeRecord{Float64}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:02.600, v=2.6)

merge(SVector, ts, ts2)
>> 7-element TimeSeries{SVector{2, Float64}}:
    TimeRecord{SVector{2, Float64}}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:01, v=[1.0, 1.5])
    TimeRecord{SVector{2, Float64}}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:01.500, v=[1.5, 1.5])
    TimeRecord{SVector{2, Float64}}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:02, v=[2.0, 2.0])
    TimeRecord{SVector{2, Float64}}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:02.600, v=[2.6, 2.6])
    TimeRecord{SVector{2, Float64}}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:03, v=[3.0, 2.6])
    TimeRecord{SVector{2, Float64}}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:04, v=[4.0, 2.6])
    TimeRecord{SVector{2, Float64}}(t=1970-01-01T00:00:05, v=[5.0, 2.6])
